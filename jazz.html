    <p>Jazz music is an incredibly unique and diverse style of music that primarily developed over the 20th century. Many different aspects of music, such as dissonance, improvisation, and swing, are attributed to varying styles of jazz. Genres, like Free Jazz, Bebop, and Blues all grew from this form of music. </p>

    <h3>The History of Jazz</h3>
  
    <p >Jazz began from West African and European roots. Slavery that existed within America had been the cause for how the genres of music intertwined, and the primary development of jazz came from New Orleans, Louisiana. Some of the most notable jazz musicians include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Charlie Parker, who were, respectively, major influences in the progression of Swing, Orchestral jazz, and Bebop. There were many more styles that are closely related to the term “jazz”, but as time passed, jazz became incredibly diverse, less defined by certain styles of the music.</p>

    <h3>Favourite Jazz Songs</h3>
  
    <p>I, personally, quite like certain jazz songs. I first learnt about jazz when I took saxophone lessons, and grew more familiar with different jazz music standards and concepts. Exploring more about music after that, I started noticing jazz everywhere, whether it be songs that I played or listened to. Though I've only been introduced to a small variety of many, great songs in this genre of music, I've brought together a few that are my favourite. These songs are impossibly creative and each their own unique work of art. I hope that you find them enjoyable.</p>
