			<p>Beethoven was a prolific composer born December 1770. He composed many incredibly famous works, such as Fur Elise, Moonlight Sonata, and Ode to Joy. In the later years of Beethoven's life, he began to grow deaf. This posed a great struggle to his mental health and well being. Despite this, he still created many of his greatest works during this time.</p>
